# 3.12 CS 216 In-Class P2 Example - Swimming Pool

## Overview
A local swimming pool distributor needs a computer program that will calculate the number of gallons
of water needed to fill the pool given the length, width, and depth of the pool. The distributor knows that approximately 7.5 gallons of water are needed for every cubic foot of the
pool. The distributor has a truck which can carry 4,000 gallons of water.

## Requirements
Write a Python program that will perform the following:

### Input
1. input the length, width, and depth of the pool in feet.

### Processing
2. Calculate the number of gallons needed to fill the pool.
3. Calculate the number of trips needed to fill the pool.

### Output
4. Display the number of gallons of water needed formatted to one decimal places and formatted
with commas. Format of the message must be "A pool that is 100 feet in length, 20 feet in
width, and 6 feet in depth will require 300.45 gallons of water."
5. If the number of trips is more than one, display the number of trips that will be needed. Display
the number of trips that will be needed. Format of the message must be "You will need 4 trips."
6. If the number of trips is one or less, display the message "Only one trip is needed."

### Planning
- Start by creating and submitting a ## Input Processing Output chart to plan your program.
- Create and submit two sample calculations by hand to test your program.
- Submit your code for grading. You may submit your program as many times as needed to pass
the sample output tests.
